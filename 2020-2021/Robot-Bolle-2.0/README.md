# Robot-Bolle-2.0
A Choreograph project to make dance a virtual NAO, created for the NAO Competition of the Artificial Intelligence M.Sc. of University of Bologna by Valentina Boriano, Piero Castriota and Pietro Fanti.

The Robot use a breadth-first graph search to choose mooves to best fit the duration of the dance. Eventual pauses are evenly distributed over the entire dance.
