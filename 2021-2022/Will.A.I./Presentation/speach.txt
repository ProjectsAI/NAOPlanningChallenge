1 intro 
Hi guys I'm Nicol√≤ Donati and together with Riccardo Grassi we formed the WILL.A.I team

2 slide 45 sec
We obtained the available time by subtracting from the 3 minutes time limit the execution time of the mandatory moves.
Then divided it in smaller equal intervals and assigned it to each step. A step is composed by the set of moves from one mandatory position to the next.
At completion of each step we add the spare time to the next.
To compute the execution time of a move we average its execution time in different situations.

3 and 4 slide 45 sec
To find the usable moves in a certain state we applied three constraints:

Time constraint that Check if there is enough time remaining in this step.

then Verify that Standing/Sitting preconditions are satisfied.

Creativity Constraint checks if this move is different from the last five.

Viable solution for a step is composed at least by 5 moves.
we wanted to make sure that the choreography is diverse in each step. 
To do so we implemented a function that computes the Entropy of the whole choreography based on Claude Shannon definition.
During testing we tuned the entropy parameters for each step making tradeoffs between reliability and creativity.

5 slide 30 sec
The search strategy that we chose after few experiments is A*. On this slide you can see the simple heuristic that we used: the cost to reach the goal is the product between the number of remaining moves and the average time of our moves set. The Average time is a mean over the estimated time of execution for each move.
