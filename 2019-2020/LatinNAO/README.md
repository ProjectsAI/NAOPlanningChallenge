# latinNAO
Project of Fundamental of AI in which NAO robot will dance following a choreography

Song: Con Calma by Daddy Yankee ( The file song3.wav is inside of the project folder)
Gender: Reggaeton
Participants:   Angely Oyola and 
				Marcello Sicbaldi

Goals:
This project has got the following goals:

1) To stimulate the comprehension and
   the discussion regarding the basic
   algorithm for planning, in the context of
   AI discipline   
2) To test your skill on a fun and intuitive
   case study: the humanoid NAO robot
3) To devise techniques for automatic and creative generation of
   complex movements in robots, such as choreographies
 
Rules:
And the rules are:

1) Each group must plan a choreography (sequence of
   positions) given a problem description
2) Each group must choose a music suitable for the
   choreography (by respecting the total time limit of 3 minutes)
   and test it on the virtual NAO (using Choregraphe)
3) A day of voting will then take place (during the last lectures)
   in which the winning choreography will be decided,
   considered the most satisfying from the artistic point of view
4) We must use mandatory positions and also intermadiate ones.

This project can be cloned or forked using github 

Requirements:
1) Python 3.5 installed
2) Choregraphe 2.1.4.13 ( or above ) installed
