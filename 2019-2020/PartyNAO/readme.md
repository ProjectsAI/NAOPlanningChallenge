It's necessary to install ffmpeg in order to be able to process the audio. 

To run our project you have to set the correct port of the robot in the file "party_nao_project.py" and "party_nao_problem_def.py".
Then, you have to open a terminal in the main folder of the project and launch "party_nao_project.py". 


Our program will select a song randomly, plot its amplitude, run simulated annealing e find the best sequence for that song. 
Then, it will automatically start the music and the choreography.

We tested our project on Linux system, so it is recommended to run the program on a UNIX system (4 GB of RAM at least).
